# Delete Your Yaptics Account

We respect your privacy and give you full control over your data.  
If you wish to delete your Yaptics account, you have the following options:

---

## üì± Delete Account from Inside the App
1. Open the **Yaptics app**.
2. Go to **Profile > Settings > Delete Account**.
3. Confirm your choice.  
   - This will **permanently delete your account and all associated data** (moods, journals, name, email).

---

## üìß Request Account Deletion via Email
If you are unable to access the app, you may also request account deletion by emailing us at:

**support@yaptics.app**  

Please use the same email address linked to your Yaptics account for faster processing.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- When you request deletion, our system will **call a secure Supabase function** to remove your account and all data linked to it.
- Deletion is **permanent and cannot be undone**.
- Data is erased immediately from our servers once deletion is confirmed.

---

## üéôÔ∏è What About Voice Notes?
- Your **voice notes are stored locally on your device** (not on our servers).
- When you delete your account, **these files are not automatically removed**.
- You can:  
  - **Manually delete them** from your device storage, or  
  - Use the app‚Äôs **Import/Export feature** to back them up before deletion.
- If you previously exported your voice notes (e.g., to Google Drive or Downloads), those backups remain in your control. We **cannot access or delete them**.
